2. Write a prefix stack and show how it works (in main). 

In this program, we are asked to write a prefix stack. In the prefixCalculator function, we take string x as a parameter. The string would be a good expression that is either a number or operator. Then we make a stack that is double data type. I initialize the stack with size 100. Double num is a variable that will hold the number. The for loop starts at the top of the stack and decrements. It then checks to see if char is a number or operator. If it is a number, then we subtract it from ‘0’ to make it a proper number. Then it is pushed on the stack. If char is not a number, then make variables op1 and op2 to hold the two top elements. We use the switch statement to use the correct operator.  Once the case is applied, it pushes the result on the stack. It then breaks off the switch statement loop. One special case is division since division by 0 is an error. Once the function finishes, it returns the top of the stack. In the main function, we write an expression and put it in the prefixCalculator function. The result should be 54 and it is correct.
